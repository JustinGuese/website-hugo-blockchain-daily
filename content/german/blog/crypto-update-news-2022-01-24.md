## [Latest Solana Clog Causes Liquidation Bloodbath (2 minute read)](https://cryptobriefing.com/latest-solana-clog-causes-liquidation-bloodbath/)

The Solana network suffered congestion issues over the weekend as crypto assets plummeted. Many DeFi users who had taken out loans needed to top up their collateral during the price drop to avoid becoming liquidated.

## [Will a non-EVM overtake compatible chains in 2022? (4 minute read)](https://cryptoslate.com/will-a-non-evm-overtake-compatible-chains-in-2022/)

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the core of the Ethereum network. EVM to Ethereum is like a CPU to a computer. EVM compatible blockchains create a code execution environment similar to the EVM, so developers can easily deploy protocols to the chain and users can enjoy lower gas fees, faster settlement, and the same address format as Ethereum. Non-EVM chains promote more innovation, but there are higher costs for developers and users. This article compares the benefits and disadvantages of EVM compatible and non-compatible blockchains to help readers better evaluate the potential of projects from a different perspective.

## [Blockchain and the evolution of business models in the game industry (9 minute read)](https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-and-the-evolution-of-business-models-in-the-game-industry)

Blockchain games are fundamentally different from traditional games as they give players full control over the digital assets they earn or acquire in game. In traditional games, the money and assets remain the property of the publisher or developer, so users are not free to sell or trade items however they want. Users can also lose all their items and data if the game decides to ban them for whatever reason. This article explores the history of business models in the game industry and how blockchain will be used in the future for gaming, looking at how blockchain can benefit both gamers and developers.

## [Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Sets New All-Time High (2 minute read)](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/21/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-sets-new-all-time-high/)

Bitcoin mining hit an all-time high of 26.64 trillion on January 21. The previous record was in May 2021 when it hit 25.04 trillion. Mining difficulty is automatically adjusted based on the computational power in the network. The difficulty dropped after May 2021 when Chinese miners shut down due to regulations. Many Chinese miners have come back online in North America, explaining the rise in mining difficulty. Mining is expected to continue to become more difficult as miners deploy more machines around the world.

The White House is preparing to release an executive order as early as next month that will outline a comprehensive government strategy on cryptocurrencies.
