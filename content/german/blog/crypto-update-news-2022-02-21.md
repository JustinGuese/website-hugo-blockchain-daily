## [Wyoming Lawmakers Want State to Launch Its Own Stablecoin (3 minute read)](https://decrypt.co/93294/wyoming-lawmakers-state-stablecoin)

It is not clear in the bill why the state needs its own stablecoin, but it makes sense given the state's increasing focus on crypto.

## [JPMorgan unveils research on quantum resistant blockchain network (2 minute read)](https://cointelegraph.com/news/jpmorgan-unveils-research-on-quantum-resistant-blockchain-network)

Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) blockchain networks are resistant to potential quantum computing-based attacks. QKDs use quantum mechanics and cryptography to allow parties to exchange secure data and detect and defend against third parties attempting to eavesdrop on the exchange. They are capable of supporting 800 Gbps data rates under real-world environmental conditions. Production-quality quantum computers will change the security landscape of technologies like blockchain, so it is important to develop secure blockchain infrastructure before they hit the market.

DustSweeper is a service that allows users to swap small balance tokens for ETH without expensive gas transactions. Many Ethereum users have low-balance tokens from old trades, airdrops, and trying out apps. Cleaning out these wallets requires paying high gas prices. DustSweeper users just have to approve the tokens they want to sell and then bots execute the swap. The transaction fees are significantly smaller. A demo video showing how it works is available.
