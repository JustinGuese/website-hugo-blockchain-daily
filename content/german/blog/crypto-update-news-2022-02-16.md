## [Why Are Fees on Ethereum Dropping? (2 minute read)](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/15/why-are-fees-on-ethereum-dropping/)

EIP 1559, an update to the Ethereum ecosystem, was activated in early August 2021. The update made it so every transaction required a set base fee to be included in a block. The base fees paid are sent to a burn address to counteract inflation. This change reduced fee volatility, making spikes less intense during token launches, but this also meant that fees could take weeks to fall back down. Transaction fees have dropped overall, resulting in an increase in network activity.

## [How the Marshall Islands Is Trying to Become a Global Hub for DAO Incorporation (2 minute read)](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/15/how-the-marshall-islands-is-trying-to-become-a-global-hub-for-dao-incorporation/)

The Republic of the Marshall Islands has become the first sovereign nation to recognize decentralized autonomous organizations as legal entities. DAOs in the nation will have the same privileges as limited liability corporations and will be able to hold real estate. They will not have to register separate LLCs. The island nation aims to become a hotbed for DAOs. It may be attractive to investors as the island is not subject to US federal laws while still having access to US Postal Services, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the US Military.
