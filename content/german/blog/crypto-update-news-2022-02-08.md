## [A Walk Through the Dark Forest (11 minute read)](https://mirror.xyz/unitzero.eth/XOWkcDGhjy3nM3WdjcpWXR6tPufD3uLTEKUsy6YDay8)

Maximal/Miner Extractable Value (MEV) is a measure of the profit a miner can make through their ability to arbitrarily reorder transactions within the blocks they produce. Miners can reorder transactions based on who is paying the most in gas, a fact which many users take advantage of. It is possible to monitor transactions waiting to be processed to find profit opportunities. This article discusses several strategies for exploiting MEV opportunities for profit, the threats posed by MEV, and how researchers will mitigate the risks MEV poses to Ethereum and its users.
