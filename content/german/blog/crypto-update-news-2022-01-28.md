## [Announcing Shutter Governance - Shielded Voting for DAOs (8 minute read)](https://shutter.ghost.io/announcing-shutter-governance-shielded-voting-for-daos/)

This article discusses Shutter Governance and how it could be used to improve governance in decentralized organizations.

Shielded voting encrypts votes to create pre-voting information symmetry, censorship resistance, and partial privacy to improve voter misbehavior, voting apathy, and to fix some governance incentive systems. While it has clear advantages, using the system could increase gas costs, operational overhead, and the system's complexity in general.

## [How 2021 Became One Of The Most Surprising, Formative Years In Bitcoin Mining (4 minute read)](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/reviewing-2021-in-bitcoin-mining)

## ['Snow Job': The Plot to Hand the Crypto Industry to the Big Banks (14 minute read)](https://decrypt.co/91301/federal-reserve-crypto-regulation-plan-stablecoins-big-banks)

The Federal government is planning to use federal agencies to squeeze stablecoin issuers to ultimately benefit big banks.

When Facebook first announced its intention to offer a stablecoin to its more than 2 billion users, Congress snapped to attention and blocked the development of the coin due to its potential to challenge the government's power. By controlling the stablecoin market through regulation, the government can create opportunities for tax collection and slow the growth of the crypto market. Recent actions by regulators suggest that the plan is already in action.
