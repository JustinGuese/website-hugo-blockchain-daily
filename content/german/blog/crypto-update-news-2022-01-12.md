## [Ronin: The Engine Powering Axie Infinity’s Growth (9 minute read)](https://www.nansen.ai/research/ronin-the-engine-powering-axie-infinitys-growth)

Ronin is an Ethereum sidechain that was created to be an industry-leading blockchain for gaming. It was built with Axie Infinity’s community in mind, as Ethereum was limiting the game's ability to attract new players and retain existing ones. Ethereum would have spikes in gas fees and network congestion that would slow the game's economy to a halt. Ronin optimizes for near-instant transactions and negligible fees, allowing for millions of in-game microtransactions to occur seamlessly. This article explains the Ronin ecosystem and gives an overview of how to exchange, store, stake, and transfer assets within the sidechain.

## [Solo Bitcoin Miner With Only 120 TH Finds Valid Block (2 minute read)](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/solo-bitcoin-miner-finds-valid-block)

A solo bitcoin miner recently won a 6.25 BTC reward, worth about $265,600, after adding a new valid block to the Bitcoin network. The miner had a hashrate capacity of about 120 TH/s, 10,000 times less than most public bitcoin miners. With that hash rate, the miner had about a 1 in 10,000 chance of finding a block per day. Having a higher hashrate increases the chances of finding a valid block as miners can try more computations per second.
