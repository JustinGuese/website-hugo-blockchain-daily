## [baseplate thesis (10 minute read)](https://mirror.xyz/samidefi.eth/UQ8_M77g4qx1CT0QH00GUTWViW41aSxX0V7MwetNb8I)

Too many DeFi protocols focus too much on value capture and not enough on value creation. The fat protocol thesis hypothesizes that value in web3 will be concentrated at the protocol layer and only a fraction of that value will be distributed at the applications layer, the inverse of what happens in web2. Using incentive mechanisms to keep value within an economy creates a closed-loop incentive structure, which can cause a DeFi protocol to fail. DeFi applications can evolve from exchanges into protocols by inviting external actors to leverage incentive structures for their own best interests.
