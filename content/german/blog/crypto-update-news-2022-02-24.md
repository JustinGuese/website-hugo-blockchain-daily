## [StarkWare Launches Layer 2 Product StarkNet on Ethereum (1 minute read)](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/02/23/starkware-launches-layer-2-product-starknet-on-ethereum/)

StarkWare's StarkNet layer 2 protocol is ready for the deployment of decentralized apps. StarkNet uses zero-knowledge rollup technology to solve Ethereum's scaling problem. ZK rollups batch together hundreds of transactions into one to be written onto the Ethereum blockchain. They reduce gas fees significantly as only one transaction is processed instead of hundreds of individual smaller transactions. StarkNet is expected to achieve one order of magnitude higher transactions per second than Ethereum at a cost at least two orders of magnitude lower by the end of 2022.
