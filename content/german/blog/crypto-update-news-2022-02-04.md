## [Move toward digital dollar gains steam as Boston Fed says its prototype can handle 1.7 million transactions per second (5 minute read)](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/move-toward-digital-dollar-gains-steam-as-boston-fed-says-its-prototype-can-handle-1-7-million-transactions-per-second-11643916607)

The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and MIT recently released research on the technological viability of a Central Bank Digital Currency. The research proposes two potential architectures for a US CBDC, with one theoretically able to handle 1.7 million transactions per second, settling transactions in less than two seconds. Americans are already using digital forms of money to execute most transactions. A CBDC could foster greater financial inclusion with those who are skeptical of banks. The next phase of the research will look into making the digital dollar interoperable with other CBDCs and potentially cryptocurrencies.

## [Decoupling of NFTs and Crypto Spurs Debate About Future of New Asset Class (4 minute read)](https://thedefiant.io/nfts-decouple-crypto-market/)

While the crypto market drops into bear territory, the NFT market remains at an all-time high. NFTs have gone rapidly mainstream, with many businesses, artists, collectors, and crypto enthusiasts embracing the technology. People are not only buying NFTs for profits, but for many other reasons like identity, community, and an emotional connection with art. This is in contrast with those in the crypto community who may not be attached to their tokens in the same way. Like all markets, the NFT market will likely see a correction phase. The correction will determine whether NFTs are a true asset class or if they're just a pop-culture fad.

## [Who owns your address in AR? Probably not you (12 minute read)](https://www.protocol.com/entertainment/upland-augmented-reality-real-estate)

Upland is a blockchain-powered game that lets people buy, develop, rent out, and sell virtual land parcels based on real-world property borders. The game is focused on fun, with most of its in-game transactions having little to no monetary value in the real world. Upland plans to eventually expand into AR and allow third-party developers to one day build their own game and non-game applications with its platform. How these worlds handle real and virtual world property rights will be an important discussion as virtual land games become more popular and develop more real-world utility.
