## [DeepDAO Launches Search Engine to Find Financial, Membership Data for DAOs (3 minute read)](https://decrypt.co/91465/deepdao-search-engine-daos)

DeepDAO has launched a search engine to help people find answers to the most common DAO-related questions. The feature will allow users to find information such as who holds the most tokens in a DAO, users' governance profiles, wallet addresses, and sometimes even the names of DAO members and links to other DAOs that share the same members. The information is gathered from various sources, including the DAO's blockchain. DeepDAO currently lists over 4,100 organizations that manage a combined $8.2 billion. It plans to offer data explorers and access to its API in the future.

## [FriesDAO Wants to Start a Crypto-Crowdfunded Fast-Food Franchise (3 minute read)](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/28/friesdao-wants-to-start-a-crypto-crowdfunded-fast-food-franchise/)

FriesDAO, a not-yet decentralized nor autonomous organization, is raising funds by selling a token that will allow its buyers to vote over which chain restaurant it buys. The token will not give holders ownership rights, a stake in its profits, or a final say in FriesDAOâ€™s business. US security laws prevent FriesDAO from adding more utility or incentives to the token. FriesDAO chose to purchase a franchise as it would be the easiest way to set up a new restaurant. It is led by two people with known real-world identities who have the expertise to deliver on the project's goals.

## [A quick reminder of what "shared security" means and why it's so important (2 minute read)](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/sgd3zt/a_quick_reminder_of_what_shared_security_means/)

Smaller chains are often much easier targets for attackers since achieving 51% control takes much fewer resources. The way the smaller chain is implemented can have a large impact on the outcome of an attack. Independent L1s and sidechains can have funds from all wallets stolen, but rollups, plasmas, and validiums can keep funds safe, even if the network is delayed or locked up. Smaller chains that use larger chains for security have a shared security zone. Moving assets from a smaller chain to another chain that doesn't have the same shared security zone (eg. a sidechain) makes the asset less secure.

## [A list of open problems in DeFi (3 minute read)](https://mirror.xyz/0xemperor.eth/0guEj0CYt5V8J5AKur2_UNKyOhONr1QJaG4NGDF0YoQ)

This article contains a list of open problems in decentralized finance. While yield stacking is impressive, solving problems that extend decentralization to real-world products or fixing errors in current systems is what will lead to more adoption. Some of the problems discussed include the automated risk scoring of lending borrowing pools, decentralized public goods incentivization, and better fiat on-ramps and off-ramps.

## [Consensus Capital Markets (15 minute read)](https://mirror.xyz/alkimiya-protocol.eth/PbTyQ3JnVtGq54fLjDr9toMLliWX_HMox9PQCFkZvsw)

Commodities are basic raw materials that serve as the basis for the production of everyday goods and services. All economic activity on public blockchains settles on blockspace, making blockspace a commodity. As it is a commodity, it can be used to hedge against production or enhance returns. This article discusses the history of commodity markets, the importance of decentralized consensus, the economics of consensus production, and what a crypto-native capital market for consensus will look like. As crypto usage increases, the demand for blockspace and the incentives for becoming a producer of blockspace will grow.

## [A Look At Ronin (16 minute read)](https://www.decentralised.co/understanding-ronin/)

Ronin is an Ethereum sidechain built for the Axie ecosystem. It is optimized for near-instant transactions and nominal fees, making it perfect for games. By launching the sidechain, Sky Mavis, creator of Axie Infinity, has become an infrastructure provider for blockchain games. Ronin has 3.75 million monthly unique users, more than enough to attract developers to the platform to build on. With support from companies like Ubisoft, Sky Mavis is in a better position than other blockchains to enable indie developers to grow.

## [Hackers have stolen $80 million in cryptocurrency from the Qubit DeFi platform (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/28/22906366/cryptocurrency-hackers-steal-qubit-binance-ethereum)

Hackers have stolen around $80 million in cryptocurrency from decentralized finance platform Qubit Finance. Qubit provides a bridge service between Ethereum and the Binance Smart Chain network. The hackers exploited a flaw in Qubit's smart contract code that allowed them to deposit 0 ETH and receive almost $80 million in Binance Coin in return. Qubit has directly appealed to the hackers to ask them to negotiate in order to minimize losses.

## [Ethereum User Loses Over $500,000 Forever after Sending ETH to Wrapped Ether (WETH) Contract (2 minute read)](https://timestabloid.com/ethereum-user-loses-over-500000-forever-after-sending-eth-to-wrapped-ether-weth-contract//1/0100017eb0719030-159010d6-732b-4670-938f-0b77c930fdc6-000000/Ikr-8XvWpS0jDBvjXHOGNMI1UpgmyKLovKVvRDzn56k=234)

A Reddit user recently sent $500,000 worth of tokens to the wrong address and lost them forever. The user attempted to convert their Wrapped Ether back to Ethereum by sending it to the same address used to convert Ethereum into Wrapped Ether. The smart contract for converting Ethereum to Wrapped Ether only goes one way, so the tokens are locked away for good. Users must use a frontend to make the correct conversion. The crypto community reacted heavily to the ordeal, with some pointing out that these kinds of mistakes are preventing crypto from becoming mainstream.
