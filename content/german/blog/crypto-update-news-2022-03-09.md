## [Incredibly excited to share the launch of Avalanche Multiverse (Twitter thread)](https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1501263471496761345)

The Avalanche Foundation has launched Avalanche Multiverse, an up to $290 million incentive program focused on accelerating the adoption and growth of its subnet functionality. Avalanche's subnets allow individuals or institutions to build custom blockchains tailored to their needs. They make implementing compliance, data privacy, and performance easy for anyone that wants to participate in DeFi. Developers can use subnets to create apps that don't have to compete with other communities for network resources. A link to join the Multiverse incentive program is available in the thread.

## [An Introduction to Sidechains (5 minute read)](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/an-introduction-to-sidechains/)

This article explains what sidechains are, how they work, and the potential for them to expand the scope, scale, and dynamics of blockchain technology. The concept of a sidechain was first published in 2014 and involved many notable authors. In the paper, the authors note that Bitcoin's infrastructure faced trade-offs between scalability and decentralization, as well as concerns about privacy and censorship, and propose sidechains as a solution. Sidechains are separate blockchain networks that connect to a parent blockchain via a two-way peg. They have their own consensus protocols, allowing for improved privacy and security and minimizing the trust required to maintain a network.
