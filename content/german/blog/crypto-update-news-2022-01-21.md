## [Protocol Frontends as Competitive Marketplaces (4 minute read)](https://hexonaut.medium.com/protocol-frontends-as-competitive-marketplaces-457b0c4ec1c7)

Users do not want to run their own servers. A solution to the problem could be to build many competing platforms on a blockchain to let the free market decide which platform to use. If a particular platform decides to block any information, the information remains on the blockchain, so other platforms can still make it easily accessible to users. This will mean that users can also easily transfer between platforms without losing any information.
