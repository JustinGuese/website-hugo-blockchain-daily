## [Arming Part-Time Contributors in Web3 (4 minute read)](https://mirror.xyz/0x7B0befc5B043148Cd7bD5cFeEEf7BC63D28edEC0/lVl4IAoxKYRgiQiyTYOiJZuCzN9D7fwdogXoMkwmToI)

At the moment, the concept of a DAO is miles ahead of the actual experience of one. While many new participants want to contribute to projects, most end up doing very little after buying tokens. Contributors may be put off by disorganized Discords, insufficient software, a lack of communication, or delayed payments. DAOs need a healthy group of contributors to live up to their potential. The way to get contributors involved in projects is through setting up the right tools and incentives. Layer3 is developing a platform that will allow contributors to engage with DAOs on an adhoc basis to apply their skills while receiving token compensation in a fast, streamlined way.
