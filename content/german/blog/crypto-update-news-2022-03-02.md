## [Osmosis introduces Superfluid Staking. How is this a game changer for the Cosmos ecosystem? (3 minute read)](https://cryptoslate.com/osmosis-introduces-superfluid-staking-how-is-this-a-game-changer-for-the-cosmos-ecosystem/)

Osmosis Labs has announced the launch of Superfluid Staking on Osmosis, an interchain decentralized exchange. The new feature lets users earn dual incomes by allowing staked assets to be actively used as liquidity. Liquidity providers can now choose to stake their bonded liquidity pool shares with a validator to earn bonus APR on top of fees and other incentives. Users will be able to back PoS blockchains and provide liquidity to Osmosis at the same time. The new feature will incentivize the increased health of the Cosmos ecosystem by securing smaller zones and providing those chains with liquidity.

## [The AMM Test: A No BS Look at L1 Performance (11 minute read)](https://medium.com/dragonfly-research/the-amm-test-a-no-bs-look-at-l1-performance-4c8c2129d581)

Ethereum's lack of scalability has caused a mass migration to a new generation of layer 1 blockchains. Most of these blockchains use the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which makes them compatible with Ethereum wallets and developer tools. This article looks at several layer 1 chains to compare their speed and performance. While the performance of these chains is much better than Ethereum's, the performance increase is much less than what is claimed. Using the EVM limits performance. Chains that do not use EVM perform significantly better than EVM-based chains.
