## [What Are Blockchain Bridges and How Do They Work? (4 minute read)](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-are-blockchain-bridges-and-how-do-they-work/)

This article discusses blockchain bridges, the different types of bridges, why they are used, and blockchain bridge security.

## [Why Stablecoin Interest Rates Are So Damn High (5 minute read)](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/03/07/why-stablecoin-interest-rates-are-so-damn-high/)

Stablecoins command high interest rates because demand for them constantly exceeds supply. They are useful for liquidity in exchanges and they provide investors with a safe haven when prices are volatile. Stablecoin issuers can only control exchange rates. When money is printed to hold an exchange rate peg, interest rates rise, so stablecoins printing more tokens to keep balance contributes to high interest rates. DeFi protocols lock up a lot of stablecoins, reducing supply, but many are looking to find ways to make collateral liquid.

## [Coinbase says itâ€™s blocking 25,000 Russia-linked crypto addresses (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/7/22965605/coinbase-russian-sanctions-address-blocking)

Coinbase is blocking 25,000 cryptocurrency addresses linked to Russian people or entities. It claims that Russia could evade its sanctions with crypto so it is complying with new rules imposed due to the invasion of Ukraine. The exchange is required to use blockchain analytics to identify accounts that are indirectly linked to banned users. While crypto wallets can be anonymous, transactions are traceable, public, and permanent, making it possible to crack down on illicit accounts. Some crypto companies have disagreed with the analysis that crypto can be used to bypass sanctions.
