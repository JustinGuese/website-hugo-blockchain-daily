## [The Unbundling of Opensea (6 minute read)](https://mirror.xyz/natashajuliakim.eth/YxYT9bGfvcQuc5bpMKEXewpGQYJ43fm_IVpkXrn2_v4)

OpenSea is set to become the dominant generalist marketplace for digital assets, just like eBay was for physical goods during the early 2000s. Just like eBay, the market will likely start unbundling into vertical marketplaces. The NFT market is still very young, and it is debatable how much consumer crypto adoption will be necessary for verticalized NFT marketplaces to scale. The unbundling of OpenSea will likely happen much faster than it did for eBay as digital asset marketplaces have fewer infrastructure challenges to deal with.
