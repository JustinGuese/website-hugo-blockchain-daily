## [This is the story of how @larvalabs, the creators Cryptopunks, hid a secret NFT prize almost a year ago (5 minute read)](https://twitter.com/andrewbadr/status/1503436760239464449?s=12)

One of the NFTs in the Grails drop last month was an image produced by Larva Labs. On closer inspection of the image, it contained a sequence of L shapes, which when decoded spelled out the message, 'SECRET IS IN THE PIG NUMBERS, LL'. After more investigation, it was discovered that the 64 jersey numbers on the Meebits collections spelled out an Ethereum private key that contained 0.025 ETH and a Meebit NFT. The image of the Larva Labs NFT is available in the thread.
