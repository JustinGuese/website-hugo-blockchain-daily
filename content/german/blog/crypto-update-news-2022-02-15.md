## [“Reverse ISO” will see 20 million more SundaeSwap tokens given away (2 minute read)](https://cryptoslate.com/reverse-iso-will-see-20-million-more-sundaeswap-tokens-given-away/)

SundaeSwap, a decentralized exchange on the Cardano blockchain, launched on January 20 and soon became the leading Cardano DEX. It uses an Initial Stake Pool Offering (ISO) token distribution method that has been criticized as overly complex. SundaeSwap's ISO resulted in many tokens being transferred to certain pools, making the system trend towards centralization. The exchange will now try to counter this effect by rewarding stakers who stake in eligible smaller pools from February 19 to 24.

## [Monero Supporters Beg XMR Miners to Boycott Mining Pool Capturing 44% of the Network Hashrate (3 minute read)](https://news.bitcoin.com/monero-supporters-beg-xmr-miners-to-boycott-mining-pool-capturing-44-of-the-network-hashrate/)

The Monero mining operation Minexmr commands over 44% of the network hashrate. This has caused debates in the Monero community about whether the mining pool will threaten decentralization. If a miner controls over 51% of the network, it could potentially attack the network and cause major issues like double-spends and deep blockchain reorganizations. There are more than 30 pools available, but three Monero mining pools have over 80% of the network's global hashrate. Minexmr plans to increase its pool fees to address the concerns.

## [What BlockFi’s $100M settlement with the SEC means for future of DeFi lending (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/14/what-blockfis-100m-settlement-with-the-sec-means-for-future-of-defi-lending/)

BlockFi, a crypto lending platform, has settled with the US SEC over claims that it violated securities law through its interest account offering. It will pay a $100 million penalty, the largest yet incurred by a crypto firm. The company allowed users to earn a monthly interest payment on held cryptocurrencies and illegally operated as an investment company for 18 months. BlockFi will cease sales of its unregistered lending product and will release a new compliant lending product. The ruling may have serious implications for companies selling interest-bearing DeFi products.

## [How Azukis Suddenly Became The World’s Best-Selling NFT Collection (3 minute read)](https://outline.com/u2W297)

8,700 Azukis were released on January 12 priced at $3,400 each and sold out in three minutes. The NFT collection did nearly $300 million in transaction volume across several NFT marketplaces in four weeks, more than even the Bored Ape Yacht Club.

The success of the collection may be due to its comparatively high-quality art and production value.
