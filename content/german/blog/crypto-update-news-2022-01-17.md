## [‘Wen Token?’: Polymarket’s New Airdrop Futures Market Has Answers (3 minute read)](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/14/wen-token-polymarkets-new-airdrop-futures-market-has-answers/)

Polymarket has launched Airdrop Futures, a new market where speculators can bet on whether projects will airdrop tokens. Airdropped tokens are primarily used to reward early users and to set up infrastructure for future governance decisions, but many in the cryptocurrency community describe them as 'free money'.

## [Walmart is quietly preparing to enter the metaverse (3 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/16/walmart-is-quietly-preparing-to-enter-the-metaverse.html)

## [A look at the fees.wtf airdrop and what went wrong (4 minute read)](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/130350/a-look-at-the-fees-wtf-airdrop-and-what-went-wrong)

Fees.wtf, a site that tells crypto users how much they have spent on Ethereum transaction fees, recently ran an airdrop, handing out tokens to those who had paid over 0.05 ETH on gas fees before January 1, 2022. The team failed to provide enough liquidity on launch, resulting in a competition between trading bots that led to a price crash. Despite the failure at launch, the fees.wtf team made over $1.48 million in cryptocurrency from wallet unlocking fees and a tax set on any trades of WTF tokens made by users. The raised funds will be used to help provide staking rewards. Some of the funds will be spread out between WTF token holders, with a small amount going to the project's treasury.

## [VestedERC20 (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/ZeframLou/vested-erc20)

VestedERC20 is a wrapper ERC20 token that linearly vests an underlying ERC20 token to its holders. ERC20 is a standard for Ethereum tokens. Vesting is the process of locking and releasing tokens after a given time. VestedERC20 can be used to add vesting to existing primitives, such as Astrodrop, a tool for airdropping tokens.
