## [Etherscan Creators Launch 'Ethereum Instant Messenger' Blockscan Chat (2 minute read)](https://decrypt.co/91226/etherscan-creators-launch-ethereum-instant-messenger-blockscan-chat)

The Blockscan Chat beta is now live. Blockscan Chat allows Ethereum users to message each other from wallet to wallet. Users just need to connect an Ethereum wallet to the service to use it. The service runs on Etherscan's servers, so it doesn't have the benefits of decentralization. Users who breach the company's terms can have their access suspended. Wallet-to-wallet messaging allows people to directly message asset owners to buy NFTs, which makes the service a competitor to NFT marketplaces.

## [Fantom’s “Curve Wars”: How Andre Cronje and Daniele Sesta are changing liquidity provision (5 minute read)](https://cryptoslate.com/enter-fantoms-curve-wars-how-andre-cronje-and-daniele-sesta-are-changing-liquidity-provision/)

Solid Swap is a new decentralized exchange design aimed to compete with the standard model that Uniswap pioneered. It uses a vested escrow mechanic adopted from Curve and an element that benefits both users and developers for keeping their tokens staked. Solid Swap's native token ROCK is designed to be emissions-based and highly inflationary. It will be used to decide which liquidity pools ROCK emissions should be directed to, with users receiving trading fees from only the liquidity tools they voted on. The system incentivizes token holders, rather than just liquidity providers. Many more details about how Solid Swap works are available in the article.

Ethereum's full node size is growing at an average rate of 78% per year. If it is to be used by the masses, the data must be stored in a way where node overhead is minimal. Data available proofs allow for data to be securely stored off-chain. Provably secure off-chain data storage will drastically reduce a node's storage requirements, making Ethereum more scalable.

## [Building Sustainable Web3 Games with Owned Liquidity & Tokenized Assets (6 minute read)](https://every.to/almanack/building-sustainable-web3-games-with-owned-liquidity-tokenized-assets)

Tokenized game assets are in-game items that can be obtained through gameplay and traded. Protocol-owned liquidity allows games to provide liquidity on tokens and gain revenue on traded items. This business model shows how web3 games can monetize in-game economic activity without needing to rely on constantly attracting new players.
