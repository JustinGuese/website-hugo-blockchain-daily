NFTs have gone rapidly mainstream, with many businesses, artists, collectors, and crypto enthusiasts embracing the technology. People are not only buying NFTs for profits, but for many other reasons like identity, community, and an emotional connection with art. This is in contrast with those in the crypto community who may not be attached to their tokens in the same way. Like all markets, the NFT market will likely see a correction phase. The correction will determine whether NFTs are a true asset class or if they\u0026rsquo;re just a pop-culture fad.\nWho owns your address in AR? Probably not you (12 minute read) Upland is a blockchain-powered game that lets people buy, develop, rent out, and sell virtual land parcels based on real-world property borders.

Here\u0026rsquo;s how it happened (5 minute read) Around $300 million of ETH was recently pulled out of the Wormhole contract on Ethereum in a single transaction. Wormhole is a bridge that allows users to move crypto assets between blockchains. This Twitter thread details how the hack was executed, including references to the code that was exploited. The hackers found a way to bypass signature checks, created their own tokens, and then withdrew the fake tokens through ETH.\nWormhole, a Solana cross-chain bridge, was exploited today for $325 million (5 minute read) Cross-chain bridges like Wormhole use a mint-and-lock mechanism where the contract mints tokens only after validators observe and agree that a user has deposited funds into a smart contract. Hackers in the recent Wormhole hack exploited a bug to trick the contract into minting tokens without confirming funds. Despite the size of the hack, the bug exists within the smart contract and was not the result of using a cross-chain bridge. The warnings about cross-chain bridges made recently by Vitalik Buterin were related to 51% attacks. Cross-chain bridges are not more susceptible to bugs than anything else.\nHacker Steals $320 Million From Solana, Ethereum Bridge Wormhole (2 minute read) Wormhole has confirmed that it has suffered an exploit that resulted in 120,000 Wrapped Ethereum being stolen.

The OHM protocol has a feature that grows, or rebases, staked coins by a certain percentage around every 8 hours. As OHM became popular, many OHM forks started popping up, with some offering a rebase of up to 6% every 8 hours. The automated rebase farming strategy involved holding stablecoins and using scripts that swap and stake tokens immediately before a rebase and then unstake and swap back to a stablecoin immediately after. Using it could yield profits within seconds. Unfortunately, the strategy hasn\u0026rsquo;t been possible since the recent drop in the crypto market.\nBlockchain-based decentralized messengers: A privacy pipedream? (5 minute read) There are many benefits to blockchain-based decentralized messengers in terms of privacy and data security. Blockchain-based messaging gives users anonymity and a high degree of privacy and can prevent companies and government agencies from monitoring private messages. However, blockchain technology itself could be a barrier to adoption. Network upgrades could create issues that could kill a messaging platform and transaction fees can make it prohibitively expensive, considering how much people message each other. With existing privacy message solutions like Signal, users have no reason to move to blockchain-based messaging.\nSolana Looks to Incorporate Fee Market Akin to Ethereum (3 minute read) A proposal put forward by Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko at the end of January suggests introducing a fee market on Solana to combat spam and to help users prioritize transactions.

It will issue a digital rupee sometime in the next two years. The phrase \u0026lsquo;virtual digital asset\u0026rsquo; likely refers to NFTs as well as cryptocurrencies. While the new tax does not mean crypto is legal in the country, it is a step towards giving cryptocurrencies legitimacy. Experts are concerned that the tax is too high and could deter retail investors, making them move to the equity market. A 30% income tax is standard for Indian citizens who earn more than 12 lakh (around $20,000) per annum.\n","date":"02","image":"/images/df-technews.png","permalink":"/de/blog/crypto-update-news-2022-02-02/","tags":["news","solana","crypto","kuiper","cross-chain","proposal","rebase","ohm","could","transactions","pay"],"title":"Crypto Update NEWS 2022-02-02"},{"categories":["news","nfts","virtual","value"],"contents":"Arcade Launches NFT Lending Platform as Blue Chips Hold Strong (2 minute read) Arcade has launched an NFT lending platform to bring liquidity to the NFT market.

The way the smaller chain is implemented can have a large impact on the outcome of an attack. Independent L1s and sidechains can have funds from all wallets stolen, but rollups, plasmas, and validiums can keep funds safe, even if the network is delayed or locked up. Smaller chains that use larger chains for security have a shared security zone. Moving assets from a smaller chain to another chain that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the same shared security zone (eg. a sidechain) makes the asset less secure.\nA list of open problems in DeFi (3 minute read) This article contains a list of open problems in decentralized finance.
